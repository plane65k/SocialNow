SocialNOW Community Rules

1. Respect All Users

Treat others with kindness and respect. Do not post or send messages that harass, bully, or discriminate against individuals based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, or any other personal characteristics.

 Avoid personal attacks, threats, or abusive language in posts, comments, or chats.



2. Keep Content Appropriate

No explicit, violent, or illegal content is allowed. This includes pornography, graphic violence, or anything promoting illegal activities.

 Posts and messages should not contain spam, excessive self-promotion, or misleading information (e.g., fake news).



3. One Like Per Post

Each user may like a post only once. Attempts to circumvent this (e.g., creating multiple accounts) may result in account suspension by the owners.



4. Use Chat Responsibly

Private chats are for direct communication—do not use them to harass or spam other users.

 Group chats are public within the app; keep them civil and on-topic.



5. No Impersonation or Unauthorized Access

Do not create accounts pretending to be someone else, including the owners.

 Attempts to access or manipulate other users’ accounts or the app’s systems are strictly prohibited.



6. Content Ownership

Only upload images or content you own or have permission to use. Do not post copyrighted material without consent.

 SocialNOW is not responsible for content posted by users but reserves the right to remove it if it violates these rules.



7. Owner Authority

The owners of SocialNOW have the power to:


Delete user accounts that violate these rules.

 Remove chats or posts that breach guidelines.

 Clear all storage in extreme cases (e.g., system abuse or legal requirements).




 Owner actions are final and intended to maintain app integrity.



8. Report Issues

If you encounter bugs, abusive users, or rule violations, report them to the owners via a private chat to an owner account (if available) or through an external contact method provided by the app.

 Do not exploit bugs or vulnerabilities—report them immediately.



9. Account Responsibility

Keep your login credentials secure. SocialNOW is not liable for compromised accounts due to user negligence.

 Users are responsible for all activity under their account.



10. Compliance with Laws

All activity on SocialNOW must comply with applicable local and international laws.

 Illegal actions (e.g., sharing pirated content, threats of violence) will result in immediate account termination by the owners and may be reported to authorities if required.


Enforcement

Violations: Minor infractions (e.g., a single rude comment) may result in content removal. Repeated or severe violations (e.g., harassment, illegal content) will lead to account deletion by the owners.

 Owner Privileges: The owners can enforce these rules using administrative tools, ensuring swift action against rule-breakers.

 Appeals: There’s no formal appeal process—decisions by the owners are final.
